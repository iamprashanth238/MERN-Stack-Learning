# JavaScript Advanced Functions and Scope

This repository contains my practice problems and solutions for advanced JavaScript functions and scope concepts, covered on Day 5 of my MERN stack learning journey.

## Topics Covered
- Closures
- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
- Higher-order Functions
- Callback Functions
- Arrow Functions

## Practice Problems

### Closures
1. Counter function
2. Function that returns an adder function

### IIFE
1. IIFE that logs "Hello, World!"
2. IIFE for creating a private variable and increment function

### Higher-order Functions
1. Function that executes another function
2. Function that maps an array with a given function

### Callback Functions
1. Simulated API call with a callback
2. Sum function with a callback

### Arrow Functions
1. Rewrite of problems using arrow functions
2. Custom map function using arrow functions

## Usage
