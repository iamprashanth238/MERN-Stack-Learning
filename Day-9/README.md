# Node.js-HTTP-Module-Practice

## Description
This repository contains practice exercises for working with the HTTP module in Node.js. The exercises cover setting up an HTTP server, basic routing, serving static files, and creating a simple API.

## Problems

### Problem 1: Simple HTTP Server
- Create a simple HTTP server that listens on port 3000.
- When the server receives a request to the root URL ("/"), it should respond with a "Hello, World!" message.

### Problem 2: Basic Routing
- Extend the HTTP server to handle different routes:
  - When the server receives a request to "/about", it should respond with an "About Page" message.
  - When the server receives a request to "/contact", it should respond with a "Contact Page" message.

### Problem 3: Serving Static Files
- Serve an HTML file when the server receives a request to the root URL ("/").
- Ensure that the server can also serve associated CSS and JavaScript files.
