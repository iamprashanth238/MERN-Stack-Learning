# MERN-Stack-Learning
My journey of learning the MERN stack from scratch. I know this is very late but I have been lazy to learn any technology. But I have decided to learn any technology for the next 90 days. However, I am interested in AI & ML, because the amount of time is less to learn this. After all, placement is gone start in a couple of months. I will focus on ML in my master's.
