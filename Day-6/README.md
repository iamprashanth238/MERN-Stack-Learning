# JavaScript Arrays and Objects Practice

This repository contains various practice problems and solutions related to JavaScript arrays and objects. Each script demonstrates different operations and methods that can be applied to arrays and objects, which are fundamental concepts in JavaScript programming.

## Arrays

1. `sumArray.js`: Function to calculate the sum of all elements in an array.
2. `doubleElements.js`: Function that takes an array and returns a new array with all elements doubled.
3. `filterStrings.js`: Function to filter strings that start with a specific letter from an array.
4. `maxMinArray.js`: Function to find the maximum and minimum elements in an array of numbers.

## Objects

1. `personObject.js`: Create and manipulate a person object with properties like name, age, and occupation.
2. `countProperties.js`: Function to count the number of properties in an object.
3. `topStudent.js`: Function to find the student with the highest grade from an array of student objects.
4. `mergeObjects.js`: Function to merge two objects into one.

## How to Run

To run any of these scripts, you can use Node.js. For example, to run `sumArray.js`:
```bash
node arrays/sumArray.js
